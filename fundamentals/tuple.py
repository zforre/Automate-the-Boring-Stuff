# Tuples are immutable. Tuples cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed.

# throws an error because the tuple spam is immutable

# The comma is what lets Python know this is a tuple value
print(type(('hello',))) # tuple

# You can use tuples to convey to anyone reading your code
# that you donâ€™t intend for that sequence of values to change.
# If you need an ordered sequence of values that never changes,
# use a tuple.
